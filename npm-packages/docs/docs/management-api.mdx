<Admonition type="info">
  The Convex Management API is openly available in Beta. Please contact
  platforms@convex.dev if your use case requires additional capabilities.
</Admonition>

You can provision and manage Convex projects and deployments with the Management
API.

## Authorization

The Management API uses a Bearer token Authorization header.

```ts
const token = "ey...0=";
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.convex.dev/v1/teams/41/list_projects",
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  },
);
console.log(await response.json());
```

[Team Access Tokens](/platform-apis#managing-your-own-projects) and
[OAuth Application Tokens](/platform-apis/oauth-applications) can be used in
Bearer tokens depending on whether you are using the Management API on behalf of
your own team or on behalf of the team of a user of a Convex integration you've
built.

## Required Parameters

Most Management APIs require a team ID or project ID.

When creating a Team Access Token the team ID will be available in the Convex
dashboard.

OAuth applications may request the team (or project, if using project-scoped
tokens) ID by calling the [Token Details](/management-api/get-token-details)
endpoint.

When using a team token, projects will be assigned IDs upon creation. The
[List Projects](/management-api/list-projects) endpoint may also be used to
retrieve the ID for a project.

## Responses

All API responses are in JSON format.

## Endpoints

An OpenAPI spec for the Management API is available at
[https://api.convex.dev/v1/openapi.json](https://api.convex.dev/v1/openapi.json).
